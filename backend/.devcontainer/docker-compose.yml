    # If you want add a non-root user to your Dockerfile, you can use the "remoteUser"
    # property in devcontainer.json to cause VS Code its sub-processes (terminals, tasks, 
    # debugging) to execute as the user. Uncomment the next line if you want the entire 
    # container to run as this user instead. Note that, on Linux, you may need to 
    # ensure the UID and GID of the container user you create matches your local user.
